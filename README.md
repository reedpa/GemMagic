# GemMagic
A javascript match 3 game.

It's actually kind of fun!  There are three modes: 
 * Zen, where there are no time limits and the scores don't count.
 * Score Blitz, where you have 60 seconds to get the highest total score you can.
 * Move Champion, where each move is limited to 5 seconds and you are encouraged to get the best move possible.
 
All code is written in Javascript and uses an HTML5 canvas in 2d render mode for display.  To use it yourself, you'll need to provide the images because the ones I'm using all have different licenses and I don't want to deal with the headache of dealing with that mess.  You can see what images are expected by looking at the hidden div in main.html.
 
High scores are put into your browser's local storage.
